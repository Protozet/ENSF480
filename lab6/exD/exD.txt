After changing the if 0 to if 1 in our code we found multiple errors. Our program does not allow the creation of new LoginServer objects. 
This is because it violates the singleton design pattern specifics that there can only be one instance of the singleton object. 
An object of LoginServer is unable to find user Tim as functions of LoginServer are private, and inaccessable.
